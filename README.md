# Prefab
A simple rust based tool for generating project templates.

- Heavily influenced by [Cookie Cutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/Cookiecutter).
- Makes use of the [Tera](https://keats.github.io/tera/) template language.
- Currently, a development in progress so has some sharp edges at the moment.
